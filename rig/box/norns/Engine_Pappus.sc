	// LITE - WHICH MACHINE IS THIS
	// ===================================================================
	// A factory norns is a Raspberry Pi 3 compute module. A shield is
	// whatever the owner put underneath it, which since 2019 is usually a
	// Pi 4. The whole graph - two granulators, forty-eight resonators, a
	// real short-time Fourier transform and one PlayBuf per file in audio/
	// - measures comfortable on a Pi 4 and lands at ninety per cent plus,
	// with audio dropouts, on a Pi 3. That is not a setting anybody should
	// have to find: the def that gets compiled should already fit the
	// machine it is compiled on.
	//
	// So: read the device tree, and if this is not a Pi 4 or newer, build
	// the LITE graph instead. What LITE gives up is listed at each site,
	// and pappus.lua runs THE SAME TEST (see lite_mode there) so the
	// script's own pages agree with the engine about what exists.
	//
	// Three inputs, in order of authority:
	//
	//   PAPPUS_LITE      an environment variable, for the test harness -
	//                    1/lite forces LITE, 0/full forces FULL
	//   data/pappus/     mode.txt, holding "lite" or "full" - what the
	//                    ENGINE param on PARAMS > PERFORMANCE writes, for
	//                    an owner who disagrees with the detection
	//   the device tree  bcm2711 (Pi 4, 400, CM4) and bcm2712 (Pi 5, CM5)
	//                    are FULL; any other Raspberry Pi is LITE
	//
	// A machine with no device tree at all - a desktop running scsynth,
	// which is where the tests run - is FULL. Unknown is not the same as
	// slow, and crippling a developer's laptop to be safe would hide the

			// forty-eight slots - the array Lua sends is identical either way.

			// Dropping the top three is the right three to drop: BRIGHTNESS
			// is an exponential falloff across the series, so partials four to
			// six are already the quietest, and what goes with them is the
			// upper sparkle rather than the pitch. It is not free - a bank has
			// a slightly duller character - but it is twenty-four two-pole
			// resonators, all of them recomputing coefficients every block
			// because their frequencies are modulated.

		// SEVEN POLLS, one per box on SIGNAL's wireframe.
		//
		// getnSynchronous reads the control bus through the server's shared
		// memory rather than asking for it over OSC and waiting, which is what
		// makes a per-frame meter affordable at all.
		//
		// NOT VERIFIED HERE. The CroneEngine stub this is tested against has
		// addPoll as a no-op, so the polls exist in the source and have never
		// once fired in a test. The Lua side is written to notice: a meter that
		// has never received a value draws a dash, not a zero, so a failure on
		// hardware reads as "no data" instead of as "this module is silent".
		//
		// ONE bus read shared by all seven, not seven of them. The polls fire
		// as a batch, so the naive version did getnSynchronous(7) seven times
		// per round - forty-nine float reads and seven throwaway Arrays - to
		// answer seven questions about the same seven numbers. Caching the
		// read for a few milliseconds makes a round cost one of each.
		//
		// This is sclang, not the graph: no UGen is created here and the
		// SynthDef is untouched by it. sclang is the process norns runs its
		// polls, its OSC and its engine commands in, and on a Pi 3 it is what
