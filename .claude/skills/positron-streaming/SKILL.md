# Streaming, the relay, and what each provider actually does

Measured on this account and these devices. Prices and limits move, so a claim
here is worth re-checking before a plan is built on it.

- **iOS 17.1 added `ManagedMediaSource`**, so `Hls.isSupported()` is now TRUE on
  iPhone. Any fallback written `if (!Hls.isSupported() && canPlayType(...))`
  silently stopped firing.
- **Prefer native HLS on all WebKit, and gate it on `ManagedMediaSource`.**
  `canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')` returns `"maybe"` in BOTH Safari
  and Chrome, so it cannot tell them apart — gating on its truthiness put Chrome
  on a path it cannot play. MMS is WebKit-only, so it is a capability test rather
  than a brand check. Measured on desktop Safari, same page, same 40 s: native
  advance 0.961x / latency 5.25 s / 0 errors, against hls.js 0.344x / 7.71 s /
  2 errors. **HEADLESS Chrome answers `"maybe"` too**, so the suite cannot tell
  the two paths apart: `replay`, `seek` and `flipper` all ran
  `video.src = <m3u8>` on a Chrome that cannot play it: dead picture, green
  suite, because their asserts were about decks and cue folds, not about frames.
  ⚠️ `seek` IS RETIRED (2026-09-16) and is at `archive/demos/seek-index.html`.
  All three now gate on MMS (2026-09-06). Grep for `canPlayType` before trusting
  any HLS page.
- **Safari can close a ManagedMediaSource under you.** Every buffer is dumped.
  MMS also gates loading via `startstreaming`/`endstreaming`.
- **`video.buffered` on MSE is the INTERSECTION of the source buffers.** With
  demuxed audio+video it reads 0.05 s while video holds 5 s. Never diagnose a
  "starved" player without splitting the tracks.
- **Native HLS has no recovery hooks** — no `liveSyncDuration`, no level capping,
  no `hls.latency`. Reload is the only lever, so watchdogs must be hand-built.
- **Audio-only LL-HLS is not lower latency on Cloudflare Stream — it is only
  smaller.** The audio rendition and every video rendition carry the same
  `PART-TARGET=0.5`, the same `PART-HOLD-BACK=1.5`, the same `TARGETDURATION=3`,
  and — the giveaway — the same INDEPENDENT cadence: 11 of 41 parts on BOTH,
  though every AAC frame is independently decodable and audio could mark them
  all. Measured with that packaging: audio-only 3.88 s against video-only
  3.82 s, the same, while the bytes go 418 kbps against 11.8 Mbps. What
  actually costs latency is running BOTH renditions at once (8.8 s on raw
  hls.js) — the demuxed intersection problem `low-latency-player.js` exists to
  fight. `tracks` asserts the packaging from the playlists, so the claim
  needs no stopwatch.
- **Cloudflare WHEP refuses a single-track offer.** One recvonly transceiver —
  audio alone or video alone — is `HTTP 400`, both ways, while video+audio
  negotiates in the same second. So "is audio-only WHEP lower latency" has no
  answer to measure on this provider; you cannot subscribe to it.
- **A latency target inside one keyframe interval is unreachable.** Cloudflare
  advertises `PART-HOLD-BACK=1.5` with a 2.0 s GOP, and only one part per segment
  is `INDEPENDENT`.
- **LL-HLS deliberately does not specify how a client picks its live position.**
  Every player invents a policy; that is why this tier is fiddly.
- **A live-edge part 404 is normal.** Separate it with a ceiling; do not silence
  it.
- **Cloudflare mints a new video UID on every encoder reconnect.** Cached media
  URLs 404 afterwards.
- **`-re` is a per-input ffmpeg option.** `-re -i a -i b` paces only `a`.
- **MoQ:** a relay cannot live in a Container (no inbound QUIC — dial-out only);
  IETF `moq-pub` does not interoperate with hang at the catalog layer; but
  browser→relay→browser works today at p50 ~20 ms, with no container and no Rust
  build.
- **MoQ on Safari is blocked for a good reason.** WebTransport shipped in Safari
  26.4 (macOS and iOS) and connects to Cloudflare's relay in 140 ms — but
  `@moq/net` blocks Safari by user agent (`safari: '<0'`) because of
  [WebKit 319818](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319818): the QUIC
  flow-control window never refills, deadlocking after ~16 MiB or ~7,600
  streams. MoQ opens one stream per group, so that is about two minutes.
  Bypassing it (`08-moq/?transport=force`) is worse than the bug report implies.
  Measured twice, 150 s each on desktop Safari: **6-8 frames total**, first
  stall at 20 s, and **a full page reload with a fresh WebTransport does not
  help** (7 frames then 8). The window refills at roughly one frame per minute
  rather than never. So "reconnect every N seconds" is NOT a workaround — a
  question the published bug report leaves open. Not the encoder either: Safari
  does VP8 720p realtime at 370 fps. MoQ on Safari is unusable today; Safari
  gets WHEP (25 ms measured) instead.
- **Cloudflare's MoQ relay has no WebSocket listener**, so the qmux fallback
  cannot help. `moq-relay` (self-hosted) does, via `[web.http] listen`.
- **An error string cannot tell "API absent" from "API blocked".** `@moq/net`
  emits the same "WebTransport not supported" either way, which is how a claim
  that iOS lacks WebTransport got made without anyone checking `typeof
  WebTransport` on the device. Report the capability, not the error.
- **ManagedMediaSource needs `disableRemotePlayback = true`** (or an AirPlay
  source alternative) or `sourceopen` never fires. There is no published
  low-latency guidance for MMS — native HLS is the documented low-latency path
  on WebKit, which is why the player prefers it there.

- **Stream recording cannot be turned off — ON THE RTMPS PATH.** `mode: off`
  also disables HLS playback of a live input, and `preferLowLatency` requires
  `automatic`, so 06 and 09 depend on it. **WHIP ingest is the opposite and the
  unqualified rule has already misled a plan once: WHIP RECORDS NOTHING** —
  direct-tested, 183 s against a recording-ENABLED input, 26 polls, zero assets.
  Stream-WebRTC is delivery-only, so a WHIP source costs no storage minutes and
  cannot be archived server-side either; whatever records it must do so itself. Storage is bounded by DELETING recordings; the account
  cap is 1000 storage-minutes and testing adds ~225/day.
  `deleteRecordingAfterDays` minimum is 30 — too coarse to help.
- **Stream bills MINUTES, not bytes, and from 2026-10-15 WebRTC bills too.**
  $1 per 1,000 minutes delivered on both protocols — "regardless of protocol"
  (GA notice 2026-09-08; this account delivered 246 WebRTC minutes in 30 days,
  ≈$0.25). Three consequences that are not the price. **Buffering is billable**
  and HLS minutes round up to the segment, which is the GOP — 2.0 s here — so a
  visitor who leaves after two seconds is billed for the ~3 segments hls.js
  prefetched (`liveSyncDurationCount: 3`, read from the bundled build) and for
  ~2 s on WHEP. **An idle broadcast costs nothing on WHIP and storage on
  RTMPS**, because recording cannot be turned off there. And **the 1000-minute
  cap blocks new live streams when it fills** — at ~225 min/day that is 4.4
  days, so the RTMPS path's real cost is an outage, not a bill. Because the
  meter is duration, `tracks`' 28x byte saving (418 kbps against 11.8 Mbps) is
  worth exactly $0 on this provider: audio-only is an argument for the viewer's
  connection, never for the account. Recording and HLS interop for WHIP are
  announced "in the coming months" and are NOT shipped — re-test before
  planning either way.
- **A Durable Object's OUTBOUND client WebSocket hands binary over as a
  `Blob`**, not an `ArrayBuffer` — measured `Blob`, `size` 9, `byteLength`
  undefined — and a `Uint8Array` binds to a SQLite `BLOB` column as an EMPTY
  one, silently. So a recorder can look like it stored a frame while the row
  reads back at 0 bytes with its hex head blank. `await data.arrayBuffer()`
  first, and bind the ArrayBuffer. A BLOB also comes back OUT as an
  ArrayBuffer, which has no useful `.slice()` and no iterator — wrap it before
  reading it. (`workers/backlog`, 2026-09-09.)
- **A DO's input gate does NOT cover a non-storage await.** Events are held back
  across a `storage.get`, so handlers cannot interleave there — but
  `blob.arrayBuffer()` is not storage, and two frames a millisecond apart will
  race each other into a table in the wrong order. Where order IS the product,
  serialise the handler through one promise chain.
- 🔴 **A full relay room is a silent outage, and a redeploy does NOT clear it.**
  `studio-1` sat at 16/16 and refused the board for hours — it logged
  `closed 1006`, which is what a browser reports for the relay's `503`, so it
  read as a network fault on the Pi while `/keys/` was down for everyone. The
  room was full of **orphaned harness Chromes of mine** (four profile groups,
  118 processes); killing them took it 16 → 1 and the board rejoined unaided.
  Hibernated sockets are RESTORED across a restart, so deploying the worker
  changes nothing — only the object can close a socket. It now reclaims idle
  ones **when the room is full only**, dating each from
  `getWebSocketAutoResponseTimestamp` (survives hibernation; `wire.mjs` clients
  ping and the runtime answers for free), an in-memory message time for agents
  that never ping, and a DURABLE `serializeAttachment({at})` written once at
  accept — because dating from the object's wake makes a dead socket
  un-evictable forever. `GET /room/<name>/stats` now prints per-socket idle.
  **Check `curl .../stats` before diagnosing any "cannot connect" on this
  relay**, and kill stray `user-data-dir=/tmp/...` Chromes.
- 🔴 **THE RELAY'S LIMITS ARE 1000 msg/s, A 2000 BURST AND 128 SOCKETS, AND
  THIS ENTRY SAID 60, 120 AND 16 FOR MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE RAISED.** READ from
  `workers/relay/src/index.js`, whose own comments say *"was 60 — one knob turn
  is ~60/s on its own"* and *"was 16, which a handful of browser tabs could
  fill"*; `GET /room/<name>/stats` reports the same. `demo/shell/wire.mjs`
  carried the same four stale numbers under a comment claiming it could not
  disagree with the worker, and was corrected on 2026-09-17.
  ⚠️ **THE DIRECTION MATTERS.** Every stale number was too SMALL, so anything
  reading them refuses work the relay would accept and any capacity argument
  built on them understates a room by more than an order of magnitude. A design
  was nearly throttled on this: a keyboard glissando and a held retrigger were
  budgeted against 60/s and come to about 16 and 8 msg/s, which is under one per
  cent of the real budget.
  **What is still true and is the part worth keeping:** the token bucket is
  readable off the wire and exact, and the sender is told NOTHING when it bites.
  No error, no close, no backpressure, and only a per-connection counter in the
  payload can see it. ⚠️ A gap counter cannot: a flood measured on 2026-09-17
  delivered 2030 of 6000 and reported `lost 0`, because the loss was a tail
  rather than a hole. The Durable Object hop costs **1-2 ms at p50** over the
  runtime's `ping`/`pong` autoresponse, and a full room costs the sender about
  **8 ms at p50** over an empty one with zero loss (`demo/perf-wire.mjs`).
- **`ingest.positron.studio` is the only tokenless write path.** Server-minted
  session ids, per-segment/session/address caps enforced in a DO, 6-hour TTL
  with a cron sweep. `selfrec` stays token-gated; keep the two separate.
- **MediaRecorder output reports `duration: Infinity`**, which leaves a
  transport bar with no range to scrub. Seek far past the end, let the browser
  resolve the duration, then come back.
- **The same suite read 425/429 and then 429/429, forty minutes apart, with no
  code between them.** All four failures were `now`, all downstream of frames
  never arriving, and a single two-byte range GET on the live edge segment
  answered **403 with no ACAO** while the playlists beside it were fine. So
  before treating a red `now`/`flipper` as a regression, ASK ERR — one range
  request separates "our code broke" from "the schedule moved", and they look
  identical from the harness.
- **ERR blocks live segments by PROGRAMME, not by age.** The playlists are open
  (200 + `access-control-allow-origin: *`), the segments under `/live/hls/` can
  be 403 with NO ACAO — which reaches a browser as a CORS failure, so hls.js
  holds an empty buffer and the cell just stays black. Swept at 13 points
  across each 2 h window on 2026-09-06: `etv` refused its newest ~45 min,
  `etv2` refused its OLDEST ~78 min and served the edge, `etvpluss` served
  everything. It moves with the schedule and it is not always at the edge, so
  there is no offset to hard-code. A served segment honours Range, so a 2-byte
  GET asks "will you serve this one?" — `flipper` sweeps back from the edge,
  starts where ERR will serve, and puts the refused minutes in its readout.
- **A remote `MediaStream` carries the SENDER's msid.** After a hop,
  `remote.id === local.id` and the track ids match too, so "is this the received
  stream or the source?" cannot be answered by id — it is answered by object
  identity against `pc.getReceivers()[i].track`. An id comparison passes
  vacuously in both directions.
- **`candidate-pair` RTT is not media latency.** Quoting WHEP's 25 ms RTT
  beside MoQ's 20 ms glass-to-glass flattered WHEP by ~3x. Measured the same
  way: MoQ p50 26.2 ms, WHEP p50 67.0 ms, and WHEP wins p99.
