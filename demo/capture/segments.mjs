// SEGMENTS, from the old `/capture/` and the retired `/record/` (2026-10-04,
// `plans/plan-demo-structure.md` §3.5). Both were MediaRecorder in 2 s
// segments: `record` proved that what is held never grows past two segments
// however long the show runs, with the hand-off stood in for, and `capture`
// really uploaded each segment to R2 with `?r2=1` and played the result back on
// a deck. One recorder now gives both readings.
//
// THE MODEL, WHICH IS `record`'s: a closed segment is HELD until it is handed
// off and then dropped from what is held. The hand-off is a real PUT to the
// ingest worker with `?r2=1`, and a 300 ms stand-in without it, where the
// segment goes to a local pile that plays the part of the far side. Playback
// assembles from that far side: R2 fetched back with `?r2=1`, the pile without.
//
// WHAT CHANGED IN THE MOVE:
//   - `capture`'s three R2 asserts sat inside `if (useR2)`, so its count moved
//     with the mode. Here they are two slots that always run and say which mode
//     they graded, the way `keep` already did it.
//   - `record` ran until Stop; this records a fixed 6 s show (three segments),
//     which is still more than the two the claim says is the most ever held.
//   - The readout is six cells: `record`'s four (segments, holding, worst, sent)
//     and `capture`'s where and length. `capture`'s `source` (canvas or camera,
//     which the log already says), `biggest` and `total` (which is `sent` once
//     the show is over) are gone.
