Comments cut from the code on 2026-10-14 and kept here verbatim, so the code can say in one to three lines what it cannot say itself. Each `why:` pointer in the code names one heading below.

## `rig/board/board.mjs`

### header

Above `import { format, parse, randomId, RELAY_BASE, LIMITS } from '../../demo/shell/wi`..., lines 1 to 18 before the cut.

~~~js
// rig/board/board.mjs — the instrument in a board, as a SERVICE.
//
// plan-hardware §8.7: the board is not a peer. It dials OUT to the relay and does
// its job whether or not anyone is watching; a browser, `curl` and a phone are
// all equally clients of it. Nothing here opens a listening port, so there is no
// inbound firewall hole and it works from any network that allows outbound TLS.
//
// No browser on the board. Every permission failure this month — a grant that
// expired with its CDP client, a GUI app with no GUI session, a crash-recovery
// dialog nobody could click — came from running a browser unattended. This is a
// node process reading two ordinary Linux tools.
//
//   node board.mjs --room studio-1
//   node board.mjs --room studio-1 --dry        plan, never apply
//   node board.mjs --once                       join, say hello, report, leave
//
// The envelope is `demo/shell/wire.mjs`, imported rather than copied: the same
// file the pages use, so a change to the shape cannot reach only one end.

### board-id

Above `const BOARD_ID = arg('id', process.env.BOARD_ID || null);`, lines 49 to 65 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * 🔴 THE ONE NAME THAT IS THIS BOARD AND NO OTHER. `setup.sh` mints it once at
 * install and writes it to `/etc/default/positron-board`; it is not regenerated,
 * because an id that changes is not an id.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE OTHER THREE NAMES CANNOT DO THIS JOB. `NAME` is
 * `hostname`, which is `raspberrypi` on every fresh Pi OS, so two boards
 * introduce themselves with the same word. `FROM` is per SOCKET and changes on
 * every reconnect. `ROOM` is a place, not a thing in it. The relay has no
 * authentication, no routing and no sender identity, so **the room name is the
 * only isolation this stack has** — and the moment two boards share one, they
 * flap `boardFrom` twice a beat and interleave two `aseq` counters into a single
 * playout ring. This is what a listener tells them apart by.
 *
 * ⚠️ `unset` RATHER THAN A MADE-UP DEFAULT, so a board provisioned before this
 * existed says so instead of claiming an identity it was never given.

### net

Above `const NET = arg('net', process.env.BOARD_NET || null);`, lines 67 to 72 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * The network this board is on, as `bay.mjs` reads a node's `net`: two nodes
 * with the same one are on one LAN, and an unknown one is never read as the
 * same. Unset by default, because a guess here would let a page choose a
 * transport that two buildings cannot open. `/etc/default/positron-board`.

~~~

### site

Above `const SITE = arg('site', process.env.BOARD_SITE || null);`, lines 74 to 79 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * This board's SITE in the patchbay, the first part of every port id it
 * announces. `pi-1` by default (graph-registry.mjs `BOARD_SITE`), a second
 * board is `pi-2`. Not the room: the room is where the socket lives, the site
 * is what a reader is told the thing is (plans/plan-site-names.md §0).

### audio-ch

Above `const AUDIO_CH = Number(arg('audio-channels', process.env.BOARD_AUDIO_CHANNELS |`..., lines 84 to 89 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ A `hw:` DEVICE OPENS AT ITS OWN CHANNEL COUNT OR NOT AT ALL. MEASURED
// 2026-09-30 on the Fast Track Pro: `arecord -D hw:CARD=Pro,DEV=0 -c 1` answers
// `Channels count non available`, because its capture is stereo only. So the
// device is opened at BOARD_AUDIO_CHANNELS and ONE of them, BOARD_AUDIO_TAKE
// (1-based), is kept. Not a `plughw` downmix: input 2 has nothing patched and
// its own noise would be summed into the Circuit.
~~~

### inst

Above `let synth = null, stopSynth = null, midiIn = null, inst = null;`, lines 103 to 108 before the cut.

~~~js
// ONE variable for whatever is making sound. There used to be two — one for a
// pipe path and one for the JACK ones — and fourteen sites branched on which
// was set, so every new source meant remembering both halves and every reviewer
// had to check both. They are two implementations of one interface now;
// `inst.jack` is the only thing anyone downstream actually needs to know,
// because the granular insert can only wrap what is on the JACK graph.
~~~

### starting

Above `let starting = null;`, lines 110 to 114 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ Set BEFORE any await in startAudio. Raising a JACK chain takes ~13 s,
// and during that window `inst` is still null — so a note.on arriving mid-start
// saw 'nothing running' and started a SECOND instrument alongside it. Two
// instruments, interleaved samples, 100 msg/s into a 60 msg/s relay. Measured
// twice.
~~~

### sampler

Above `let samp = null, sampStarting = null;`, lines 116 to 122 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * 🔴 THE SAMPLER IS NOT `inst`, SINCE 2026-10-11 (option b of
 * plans/plan-sampler-pi-pico.md §2.2). It sounds BESIDE whatever `inst` is,
 * summed into the same capture, so `startAudio` for Yoshimi leaves it alone and
 * `audio.start {source: 'sampler'}` leaves Yoshimi alone. `scsampler.mjs`
 * `startPlan` is the rule, graded in `test.mjs`.
 */
~~~

### collide

Above `const collide = createCollideService({ onFrame: (f) => sendPcm(f), log: (l) => l`..., lines 124 to 129 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * Programs a page typed, on the board's scsynth (`scollide.mjs`,
 * plans/plan-pi-supercollider-defs.md). Which scsynth is `ENGINE` there, one
 * line. It answers `sc.*`, `clock.ping` and the `collide` node's notes and
 * nothing else, and starts nothing until `audio.start {source: 'collide'}`.
 */
~~~

### fx-asked

Above `let fxAsked = null;        // { by, at, on } — the last client to change it`, lines 136 to 160 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * 🔴 WHO ASKED FOR THE INSERT, AND WHEN — because two pages fight over one
 * Raspberry Pi and until 2026-09-14 neither of them could see it happening.
 *
 * `/grains/` switches the granulator ON, because the granulator is its entire
 * subject. `/keys/` used to switch it OFF on load, so whichever page you opened
 * last won, SILENTLY, and the other one went on drawing a picture that was no
 * longer true.
 *
 * ⚠️ `/keys/` SENDS NOTHING ABOUT THE INSERT SINCE 2026-09-16 and has no
 * granulator on it at all. What its message was protecting against is real. An
 * insert left in by a `grains` tab that was simply CLOSED goes on wrapping
 * whatever the next page plays and feeds its own delay, MEASURED 2026-09-12 at
 * a steady -6.1 dBFS subsonic drone while `board.alive` reported `voices: 0`.
 * `sweepInsert()` below is where that guarantee lives now. ⚠️ That is the worst shape there
 * is, and it is the reason the first half of this is REPORTING rather than
 * arbitration: arbitration that hides a conflict converts a visible problem
 * into an invisible one. The board knows the truth about its own insert; the
 * pages were guessing. Now it says so — in `fx.pappus`, in `audio.status` and
 * in the five-second `board.alive`, so a page learns about a change it did not
 * make without polling for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ A CLIENT ID IS PER CONNECTION (`openWire` mints a new `from` every time),
 * so this is never a claim that outlives the tab that made it.

### fx-asked-shape

Trailing comment on line 161 before the cut.

~~~js
let fxAsked = null;        // { by, at, on } — the last client to change it
~~~

### client-seen

Above `const clientSeen = new Map();          // from -> ms`, lines 163 to 174 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * When each client was last heard from, so "is anybody still there" can be
 * answered without a lease.
 *
 * 🔴 NO TTL, NO RELEASE, NOTHING TO LEAK. A lease nobody can clear is how
 * `studio-1` sat full for hours (CLAUDE.md). The relay solves the same problem
 * by DATING each socket — `getWebSocketAutoResponseTimestamp` — and reclaiming
 * the idle ones; this is that idea in a smaller costume, on the only evidence
 * the board actually has: a client that is still there keeps talking. `/grains/`
 * asks `params.state` and re-asks `grain.report` every four seconds, so a live
 * tab is three messages inside this window and a closed one is zero.
 */
~~~

### insert-held

Above `const INSERT_HELD_MS = 15000;          // 3.75 of '/grains/''s 4 s polls`, lines 176 to 192 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * How long a client may be silent before the board stops counting it as there.
 *
 * 🔴 CHECKED AGAINST `/grains/` RATHER THAN CHOSEN. That page has ONE
 * `setInterval(…, 4000)` and the first thing in it is `hello()`, which sends
 * `params.state` unconditionally whenever the socket is open. So a tab that is
 * merely sitting there with nobody touching it is a message every 4 s. With
 * the insert in it also re-sends `grain.report {on:true}` on the same tick, and
 * `source.set` until the board has answered once. So a live tab is at least 3
 * and usually 7 messages inside this window and a CLOSED one is exactly zero,
 * which is the only difference this board can actually see.
 *
 * 15 s is 3.75 of those polls. One poll lost to the relay's own caps therefore
 * costs nothing, and two do not either. ⚠️ The margin is what the number is
 * FOR: a window of 4 or 5 s would be arithmetically enough and would drop the
 * insert out from under a live page the first time a poll went missing.
 */
~~~

### sweep

Above `let sweeping = false;`, lines 206 to 236 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * 🔴 THE BOARD CLEANS UP AFTER ITSELF, BECAUSE SINCE 2026-09-16 NOTHING ELSE
 * DOES.
 *
 * `/keys/` used to send `fx.pappus {on:false, onlyIfIdle:true}` on connect, and
 * that one message was the whole guarantee: an insert left behind by a
 * `/grains/` tab that was simply CLOSED goes on wrapping whatever the next page
 * plays and feeds its own delay. MEASURED 2026-09-12, a steady -6.1 dBFS
 * subsonic drone while `board.alive` reported `voices: 0`, true about notes and
 * false about sound. The page has no granulator on it at all now, so it no
 * longer sends that message, and a guarantee that depended on somebody opening
 * a second page was never a guarantee anyway: nobody had to open one.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THERE IS NO "A PEER LEFT" SIGNAL TO PREFER TO A TIMER. Looked for
 * rather than assumed: `workers/relay/src/index.js` forwards every frame
 * VERBATIM and never parses one, so the Durable Object does not know any
 * client's `from`; its `webSocketClose()` is an empty method and emits nothing;
 * and `openWire` in `demo/shell/wire.mjs` sends no farewell on unload. The
 * relay's `/room/<name>/stats` does report a per-socket idle time, but the
 * array is anonymous and sorted, so it cannot say WHICH socket stopped. Making
 * the relay announce a departure means teaching it to read messages, which is
 * the one thing that file refuses to do.
 *
 * So it is an idle rule, on the only evidence the board has: a client that is
 * still there keeps talking. See `INSERT_HELD_MS` for where 15 s comes from.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER FIGHTS A LIVE PAGE. A granulator nobody is talking to is still
 * one somebody is listening to, and `/grains/` polls every 4 s whether or not
 * anyone touches it, so a page that is open and quiet is indistinguishable from
 * one being played, which is correct.
 */
~~~

### sweep-off

Above `fxOn = false;`, lines 248 to 251 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ THE SAME THREE ASSIGNMENTS AS THE `fx.pappus` HANDLER'S OFF PATH, and
// they have to stay the same three. A sweep that cleared the patching and
// left `fxOn` true would put the insert straight back on the next
// instrument change, which is the failure wearing a new hat.
~~~

### sweep-beat

Above `send(alive());`, lines 257 to 261 before the cut.

~~~js
// 🔴 SAID ON THE HEARTBEAT, NOT ON A VERB OF ITS OWN. Every page in this
// room already reads `board.alive` for exactly this, because it carries
// `insertState()`, and a new message type would be a second authority on
// one fact. Sending the beat NOW rather than waiting up to 5 s for the next
// one is the whole difference.
~~~

### made-source

Above `let madeSource = null;     // { spec, partials, top } while PosSource is feeding`..., lines 267 to 279 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * The generated material, when a page has asked for one.
 *
 * A sound BUILT on the board, right now, from the same description a browser is
 * building it from (plan-twins §4a). `/grains/` sends the spec and both ends
 * make the same sines, which is the whole comparison that page exists for.
 *
 * ⚠️ THERE USED TO BE A SECOND THING CALLED A SOURCE HERE, and it was a minute
 * of ERR's 1965 archive pulled to disk and written into the grain buffers. It
 * left on 2026-09-16 with the rest of the archive path; `archive/box-pappus/`
 * has it. Two things called "source" in one file is how a rename costs an
 * afternoon, so the one that is left says what it is.
 */

### pap

Above `let pap = null;`, lines 282 to 285 before the cut.

~~~js
// The granulator's own surface — the die, the drift and the grain buffers. Its
// OSC socket is opened once and kept, separately from `pappusFx`'s patching,
// because the engine keeps running while it is bypassed and a drift that
// stopped when the insert was switched off would be a drift you could hear stop.
~~~

### video

Above `let video = null, vws = null, vseq = 0, vsent = 0;`, lines 289 to 300 before the cut.

~~~js
// ── the picture, on its own socket ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠️ A SECOND SOCKET, AND IT IS FORCED BY A MEASUREMENT RATHER THAN CHOSEN. The
// relay allows 60 messages a second PER SOCKET and the audio stream is already
// 50 of them. Thirty video frames on the same socket is 80 against a cap of 60,
// and the bucket drops the excess silently — no error, no close, no
// backpressure. A picture sharing the audio socket would quietly cost a quarter
// of both. It also keeps the binary framing unambiguous: every page here treats
// an incoming binary frame as PCM.
//
// Room `<room>-video`, so a page that wants the picture opens a second socket
// to a name it can derive, and a page that does not is unaffected.
~~~

### codec

Trailing comment on line 309 before the cut.

~~~js
codec: 'avc1.42E01E',        // baseline 3.0 — what h264_v4l2m2m emits here

### frames-sent

Above `framesSent: vsent, ...st,`, lines 313 to 317 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ SENT, not delivered. This is the near side of the wire and the relay
// drops silently, so a client MUST compare it against the counter in the
// payload. A number counted here is not evidence about the far end.
// `framesSent`, not `sent`: since 2026-10-04 `sent` is the wire envelope's
// send stamp and `format()` throws on a payload field of that name.
~~~

### send-frame

Above `function sendFrame(unit, key) {`, lines 331 to 341 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * One frame out.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SEQUENCE NUMBER GOES IN THE PAYLOAD. A binary frame carries no
 * envelope, so `wire.mjs`'s `seq` cannot ride along — and the relay's caps drop
 * frames with no error at all, which is exactly what a counter exists to see.
 * MEASURED: at 8 Mbit/s the relay lost 101 of 361 frames and NOTHING else on
 * the path reported it. 8 bytes: a uint32 counter and a uint32 flag word whose
 * low bit says this frame is a keyframe, so a joiner knows what to wait for
 * without parsing NAL types.

### video-direct

Above `const videoDirects = new Map();   // peer -> { sink, waitKey, sent, dropped }`, lines 357 to 368 before the cut.

~~~js
// ── the picture on a direct link, since 2026-10-13 ───────────────────────────
// Asked: *"add direct option to all remote instruments"*, which includes
// /remote/shader-on-pi/ Shader on Pi. The same arrangement as the Pi camera on
// remote/010 (camera.mjs `attachDirect`, inputs.mjs `camDirect`): a third data
// channel `vid` on the page's direct link to this main socket, ORDERED and
// RELIABLE (a decoder fed a frame with a hole is broken to the next keyframe),
// each frame cut into 16 KB pieces by `framePieces`. Nothing is sent on `vid`
// until the page asks `video.direct` over `ctl`; `video.relay` or a closed
// channel stops it. The relay room keeps its frames for every other viewer.
// ⚠️ NO KEY HERE, UNLIKE THE CAMERA: the shader picture is already open to
// anybody in `<room>-video`, so the direct link carries nothing the relay
// would not.
~~~

### video-idle

Above `const VIDEO_IDLE_MS = 2 * 60e3;`, lines 396 to 412 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * 🔴 THE ARCHIVE SOURCE THIS IDLE STOP WAS WRITTEN FOR IS GONE, 2026-09-16.
 *
 * It played ERR's 1965 radio archive into the JACK graph on `-stream_loop -1`,
 * so it never ended, and this stopped it once the room had been empty for five
 * minutes: about 28 MB an hour, continuously, out of a public broadcaster, for
 * nobody. The whole path went instead. `archive/box-pappus/` has it and says
 * why. The picture's idle stop below is the same idea and is still live.
 */
// ⚠️ THE PICTURE NEEDS THIS MORE THAN THE ARCHIVE DID, and it did not have it.
// The mirror page asks the board to draw AS SOON AS IT LOADS, so one visit leaves
// the renderer and the hardware encoder running for ever — measured: 25% of the
// machine and 2 Mbit/s into an empty room, hours after the last viewer closed
// the tab. The same reasoning was written out in full for ERR's archive this
// morning and not applied one file over. Shorter here because nobody is
// listening to a picture nobody is watching, where a broadcast might reasonably
// play on.
~~~

### watching

Above `let lastWatchAt = 0;`, lines 425 to 441 before the cut.

~~~js
/**
 * ⚠️ A SOCKET IS NOT A VIEWER, AND COUNTING SOCKETS DOES NOT WORK.
 *
 * The first version of this asked the relay how many sockets were in the video
 * room and treated anything above one as somebody watching. MEASURED: the room
 * reported SEVEN while nothing on earth was watching — stale connections left
 * by test runs that exited without a clean close. The guard could never fire,
 * and the renderer ran for 231,300 frames, about two and a quarter hours, for
 * nobody.
 *
 * That is this repo's own rule, ignored one more time: a count is only evidence
 * on the far side of the boundary. The relay's socket count is a PROXY for a
 * viewer. The quantity in question is whether anyone is watching, and the only
 * thing that knows is the page — so it says so, every ten seconds, and a viewer
 * that has stopped saying it has stopped watching. It also, for free, covers
 * the case a socket count never could: a tab that is open but hidden.

### bank-cc

Above `const bankCC = () => 32;`, lines 464 to 469 before the cut.

~~~js
/**

### grains-shipping

Above `const GRAIN_TTL = 30000;        // how long one 'grain.report' keeps it shipping`, lines 479 to 490 before the cut.

~~~js
// ── shipping the grains ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// FOUR A SECOND, WHATEVER THE GRAIN RATE. sclang already batches at 250 ms;
// this matches that cadence rather than inventing a second one, because two
// buffers at different rates is a queue with a delay nobody chose.
//
// ⚠️ THE RELAY DROPS EVERYTHING PAST 60 msg/s AND TELLS THE SENDER NOTHING —
// measured, twice, exactly 298 messages delivered in three seconds at both 120
// and 300 msg/s. One message per grain would arrive as a sparse cloud that
// reads as a quiet granulator rather than as a dropped message, so the count of
// grains in the window travels WITH the list and a reader can tell the two
// apart.
~~~

### heard-at

Above `send({ type: 'grain.marks', seen: g.seen, marks: g.list, heardAt: g.at });`, lines 499 to 505 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ `heardAt`, NOT `at`. `at` WAS an envelope field until 2026-10-04 (it is
// `sent` now, and a payload may carry `at` again) and `format()` THREW
// on the collision — which it did, here, and took the whole board down with
// it until systemd restarted it. That throw is LESSONS #45: `at` once ate
// a payload field silently and ffmpeg was asked to seek to second
// 1,789,103,743,118, so session 18 made the collision loud on purpose. It
// worked exactly as intended on the first person to hit it since.
~~~

### ports-error

Above `const { backend: be, clients, error, hint } = listPorts();`, lines 513 to 516 before the cut.

~~~js
// `error` and `hint` ride along rather than being logged and dropped: the board

~~~

### audio-out

Above `const BYTES = FRAME * 2;`, lines 526 to 535 before the cut.

~~~js
// ---------------------------------------------------------------- audio out

### replace

Above `if (source === 'sampler') return startSampler();`, lines 557 to 562 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ REPLACE, do not refuse. This used to return {already:true} when

Above `await sweepInsert('an instrument was asked for');`, lines 569 to 578 before the cut.

~~~js
// 🔴 A NEW INSTRUMENT DOES NOT INHERIT AN INSERT NOBODY IS HOLDING. The line

### jack-synth

Above `if (JACK_SYNTHS[source]) {`, lines 596 to 599 before the cut.

~~~js
// The JACK-client instrument: yoshimi. It cannot write to a pipe, so

### source-feed

Above `if (fxOn && madeSource) sourceFeed(true, { instrumentPort: r.port, instrumentPor`..., lines 613 to 618 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ AND THE GENERATED MATERIAL, for the same reason and it is not

### one-instrument

Above `// ⚠️ 'synth' (the FM Rhodes) and 'moog' are NO LONGER OFFERED as instruments.`, lines 625 to 637 before the cut.

~~~js
// 🔴 THE SAMPLED INSTRUMENT AND THE DX7 LEFT ON 2026-09-16, and the board is
// one instrument now. `archive/box-fluidsynth-hexter/` has the code and the

//
// ⚠️ THE ONE MEASUREMENT WORTH KEEPING OUT OF THAT PATH, because it is about
// the container rather than about FluidSynth: in a `debian:trixie` arm64
// container with no /dev/snd at all and `ulimit -r` 0, `jackd -r -d dummy`
// came up, a synth registered left and right, the ffmpeg capture attached,
// and three seconds of the graph came back as 144,021 samples at peak 0.1096.

~~~js
// ⚠️ 'synth' (the FM Rhodes) and 'moog' are NO LONGER OFFERED as instruments.

 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT NAMES THE SENDER, because "who turned this down" is the other half

// that wants the picture re-asks while it is open. A board still shouting
// at an empty room a week later is the shape of failure this avoids.

// graph from before and after itself, so pressing it is a diff rather than
// a leap.
//
// 🔴 EACH ANSWERS IN ITS OWN NAME. `audio.status` answers `audio.started`,
// and that cost nine seconds and a wrong conclusion: a caller waiting on the
// obvious reply name waited out its timeout and reported that no board was

// assumed. So asking permission is not available, and a verb that
// pretended to ask would be worse than one that does not.
//
// Three things instead, and the first two are what make the third rare.
// It is a DIFF: a graph that is already right runs zero commands, so the
// ordinary case of somebody pressing recover on a healthy board is
// inaudible. It KILLS NOTHING: no process is restarted under a listener,
// only links are patched. And when it does have to cut a link it says so
// out loud, with who asked and who else the board has heard from inside
// the same 15 s window the insert uses. An arbitration nobody
// can see is worse than none, which this board settled once already in
// `fx.pappus`.
//
// ⚠️ AND A SERVICE RESTART IS DELIBERATELY NOT A VERB HERE. A process
// that kills itself over the relay cannot report what happened, systemd
// restarts it anyway (`Restart=always`), and the recovery actually asked
// for is the graph. `audio.stop` then `audio.start` already rebuilds the
// whole chain including the capture, at the cost of about thirteen

// failure alike.
// ⚠️ THE BOARD'S OWN CHAIN STILL WINS. `jack.apply` patches what it is
// told; it does not change what the board believes is playing, so a
// document that cuts the capture shows up in `jack.graph` as `extra` or
// `missing`, and `jack.rebuild` puts the board's chain back. That is on
// purpose: one source of truth about the instrument, and this verb a way to
// patch around it in the open.
// ⚠️ TOKENLESS, LIKE EVERY VERB ON THE RELAY. Its blast radius is the one

// wanted, so `fx.pappus` and `jack.rebuild` no longer undo a page's link.
// ⚠️ AN UNLINK CUTS ONLY WHAT NOTHING ELSE WANTS. `yoshimi -> capture` as a

// floor is -93.1 with a peak of 1, the same as `arecord`. alsa_in's own S16
// path is the suspect and was not chased further.

// repairs a device that sends big endian S16 under an S16_LE label, which

// showed Input 0 with no owner and the Circuit sending (Rx 130,660 bytes,
// its clock), so the input is free and has to be filtered.

// ALSA sequencer subscription to the instrument holds it, and a page that

### pre-read

Above `const pre = Buffer.alloc(1024);`, lines 773 to 783 before the cut.

~~~js
// 🔴 READ ONCE BEFORE THE REQUEST IS WRITTEN, BECAUSE OPENING THE INPUT IS

// but not yet triggered, and the trigger is the first read or poll. The
// Circuit answers the Device Inquiry faster than the first poll 10 ms

// in `/proc/asound/Circuit/midi0` Rx, while the clock after it was. Same
// script, same minute: read first, 17 byte identity 2 of 2; write first,
// nothing 2 of 2. amidi does this too ("trigger reading"). A zero length
// read does not do it from node, which returns before the syscall. What
// this read drains came before the question, so it cannot be its answer.

### cam-wait

Above `function camDirect(msg, reply, peerId, waited = 0) {`, lines 821 to 826 before the cut.

~~~js
// ⚠️ THE ASK CAN OVERTAKE ITS CHANNEL. MEASURED 2026-10-13 against the Pi:
